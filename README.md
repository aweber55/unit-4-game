Crystal Collector Game!

This game requires no installation.
It was created with Bootstrap, JQuery and javascript.



There are many console.log() in the code to check to make sure the game is running correctly.


The instructions are simple, clcik on the different crystals, which have differing corresponding values during each round of game-play, and try to attain the random value given.  If you go over the number, you lose the round. If you can get the number correctly, you win the round. After each round all numbers are reset and the insanity begins again!
